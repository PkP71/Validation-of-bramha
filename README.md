# Automated Test Script for Brahma Console

This repository contains a Python script that automates the process of connecting a wallet, signing a message, and verifying the UI on the Brahma Console website using Selenium and Web3.py.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.6+**: Download and install the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Google Chrome**: Ensure you have the latest version of Google Chrome installed.
3. **ChromeDriver**: This is managed automatically by the `webdriver_manager` package.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/brahma-console-automation.git
    cd brahma-console-automation
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Alternatively, you can manually install the required packages:

    ```sh
    pip install selenium webdriver_manager web3
    ```

## Configuration

1. Open the script file (`script.py`) and replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration:

    - Replace `https://arbitrum-rpc-url` with the actual Arbitrum RPC URL.
    - Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your private key.
    - Replace `Message to be signed` with the actual message from the UI.

## Running the Script

Run the script using the following command:

```sh
python script.py
```

The script will perform the following actions:

1. Load the Brahma Console website.
2. Click on "Connect Wallet."
3. Inject the Web3 provider and connect to the Arbitrum RPC.
4. Click on "Sign Message" and provide the requested signature.
5. Open the UI-testing console.
6. Take a screenshot of the dashboard and save it as `dashboard_screenshot.png`.
7. Assert that the text below "UI testing" says "$0.00".

## Notes

1. **Web3 Injection**: Injecting a Web3 provider into the browser often requires interaction with a browser extension like MetaMask. Automating this interaction can be complex and might require a different approach depending on the wallet provider.
2. **Waiting for Elements**: Adjust the wait times and the XPath selectors according to the actual elements on the webpage.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that the Chrome browser and ChromeDriver versions are compatible.
- Verify that the Arbitrum RPC URL and private key are correct.
- Adjust the XPath selectors if the structure of the web page changes.
